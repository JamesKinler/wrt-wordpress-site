          Zinc Chelate™ is chelated with organic and amino acids. It is an excellent soil and foliar fertilizer which helps to prevent and relieve zinc deficiencies. The mixture of organic and amino acids and selected carbohydrates facilitate its entry into the plant and utilization when
          used as a foliar or in the soil. This product is readily absorbed by the plant, translocated to various tissues and metabolized for optimum
          growth and development. Zinc Chelate™ may be combined directly with other Baicor fertilizers and will remain in solution. All plants require
          13 essential nutrients in addition to carbon dioxide, water and light. If any one of the nutrients is missing or deficient, the plant will not
          complete its normal life cycle. Zinc is required in high micro-levels by plants for maintaining enzymatic activity and auxin levels. It is
          involved in the production and use of growth regulators as well as making enzymes function correctly. A deficiency of zinc greatly reduces
          plant growth and quality of crops such as potatoes, sugar beets and wheat. Zinc Chelate™ has been tested against other well known competitor
          products in independent studies and has been shown to have significantly greater uptake and accumulation.

        <p class="calcium_12_sub">Benefits of Zinc Chelate™</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increases leaf and fruit size & quality</li>
          <li>Helps calcium translocation</li>
          <li>Essential in uniform seed formation</li>
          <li>Enzyme activator</li>
          <li>Essential for transformation of carbohydrates and helps regulate consumption of sugars to promote plant growth</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="calcium_A_sub">Deficiency Symptoms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Zinc deficiency is found in the new growth of the plant.</li>
          <li>Abnormal leaf size (small) and shape occur. Reduced chlorophyll, usually recognized by chlorotic rosette appearance or yellowed areas in new leaves.</li>
          <li>Reduced set, fruit development and size. Deficiencies will lower crop yield and quality.</li>
        </ul>
