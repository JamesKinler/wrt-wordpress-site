          Bio S.I. SD 25 is an easy-to-apply solution to address the crop stubble leftover after harvest in your fields. SD 25 helps recycle nutrients by utilizing all-natural soil-borne microbes to convert leftover plant debris from corn, wheat, beans, barley, cotton, rice, milo, beets, sugar cane,
          hops grasses and many other crops into valuable carbon (humus), which holds nutrients and water in the rhizosphere. Leftover stubble is worth far more
          than it can be sold for and SD 25 breaks it down releasing all those nutrients and other elements that are tied up in the debris. These nutrients have
          already been paid for once so using them for the next crop can result in substantial savings due to fertilizer input costs.
