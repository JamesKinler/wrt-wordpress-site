          The Water Right Technologies web site uses “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a
          Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your
          computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server
          in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to
          a specific page. For example, if you personalize Water Right Technologies pages,
          or register with Water Right Technologies site or services, a cookie helps Water
          Right Technologies to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This
          simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing
          addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Water Right
          Technologies Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so
          you can easily use the Water Right Technologies features that you customized.
