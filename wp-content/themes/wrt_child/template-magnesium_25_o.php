          Products for organic use are specially formulated with the concerned grower in mind. Based on years of research and application, Baicor® products can provide the results that certified growers have come to trust. Baicor® products may be applied to the soil or in irrigation water in addition to foliar applications.</p><br>
        <p>
          Products for organic use contain a series of selected natural organic compounds which chelate or complex nutrients and keep them in functional form until the plant utilizes them. This protects the nutrients from being tied-up within the plant or precipitation by sulfates, silicates and phosphates.
          The organic base of all Baicor® products is used as a food source by both plants and micro-organisms and is completely biodegradable thus reducing ground water contamination.
