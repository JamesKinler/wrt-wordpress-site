          This is a true All Purpose fertilizer. Many other products use this word “All Purpose” but may mislead consumers. Baicor All Purpose fertilizer contains the essential nutrients needed by the plant in a pmpletely balanced, organic-based formula, ideal for optimal plant development. It is used all around the world in
          Agriculture. All Purpose contains high balanced cenetrations of micro-nutrients compared to other all purpose fertilizers.

        <p>
          Green-Up without rapid growth: All Purpose contains a unique proprietary combination of plant-based amino acids, organic acids and carbohydrates. The chelated and complexed nutrients contained in All Purpose are rapidly absorbed into plant tissue to provide a rapid and sustainable green-up. </p><br>
        <p>
          All Purpose also contains secondary nutrients (magnesium and sulfur) and a full range of micronutrients (iron, zinc, manganese, copper and boron) which are 100% chelated to alleviate most deficiencies. </p><br>
        <p>
          Iron, zinc and manganese deficiencies are very common in calcareous or high pH soils. The plant may yellow due to iron, zinc or manganese deficiencies. Nitrogen will not correct the problem; only proper nutrition will restore the natural green color and vigor of plants. <br></p>
        <p>
          All Purpose provides plants with high levels of phosphorus and potassium, which increases plant’s tolerance to many stress conditions. There are also some indications by researchers that phosphorus and potassium play a key role in reducing disease infections.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Potassium is required in high amounts for its many functions in plants. Over 40 enzymes require it for their activity. In addition, potassium is essential for the control of the stomata and thus is important in maintaining turgidity of plants and photosynthetic activity.
            Potassium is present in the readily usable organic acid form.
          </li>
          <li>
            Nitrogen is required for the over-all growth and development of the plant. Important components like amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids, etc all contain nitrogen.</li>
          <li>
            Phosphorus is readily absorbed by the plant cells and is required for energy processes in the cells of plants.</li>
          <li>Molybdenum, Iron, Copper and Boron are contained in this product, which are all essential for good plant growth and development.</li>
          <li>
            Molybdenum is required for the conversion of nitrates to amino acids and protein. Molybdenum is essential for nitrogen fixation that occurs in plants like alfalfa or microorganisms.</li>
          <li>Boron is required for hormone maintenance and carbohydrate conversion or translocation.</li>
          <li>
            Iron is essential for chlorophyll formation. Iron is also required by the plant for many metabolic roles including nitrate reduction, nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis. Iron is an activator and component for many enzymes that control plant respiration.</li>
          <li>
            ALFALFA BLEND™ is recommended to be applied at any cycle of growing season, before first crop cutting (when sufficient leaves are present.) to enhance the yield and the RFV/protein of the crop.</li>
