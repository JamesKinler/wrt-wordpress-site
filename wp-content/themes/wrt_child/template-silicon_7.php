          Silicon is an essential mineral element for some plants and is beneficial for all higher plants. It can function as an essential trace element in metabolic roles and also accumulate in large quantities in certain tissues, cells and cellular components to enhance physical attributes of
          plants. Silicon may provide mechanical protection in the epidermal root cells acting as a barrier against pathogen and parasitic invasion. Silicon
          associates with calcium and pectin in the intercellular walls spaces in the roots providing rigidity of leaves improving photosynthetic activity.
          It reinforces the walls of the vessel cells in the xylem, preventing compression under conditions of high transpiration thus improving sap circulation.
          Silicon has important roles in the formation of new leaves, pollination, fruit formation and fruit storage. Baicor Silicon 7% has added natural components
          including amino acids and Ascophyllum nodosum enhancing uptake, translocation and effectiveness. It also provides elicitor and positive growth regulation.
