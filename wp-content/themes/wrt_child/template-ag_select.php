          Bio S.I. Ag Select is a unique blend that contains a broad and diverse spectrum of naturally occurring, beneficial soil borne microbes plus 4 different species of mycorrhizae. Mycorrhizae are beneficial fungi that help the plants and the soil at the same time along with the microbes in the solution.
          The mycorrhizal fungi establish relationships with root tissues of their plant hosts; by penetrating the cortical cells of roots, the mycorrhizal
          hyphae supply the plant with phosphorus, sulfur, nitrogen and other micronutrients the plants would not normally be able to get. All this activity
          of the microbes and fungi help release nutrients beyond what is normally available through extensive microbial and fungal associations throughout
          the soil profile.
