          Calcium is taken up through the root tips in the soil. In times of calcium demand by the plant, it may not be able to satisfy its needs by root uptake. This results in internal brown spot for potatoes, blossom end rot in tomatoes, etc. Foliar addition of calcium
          assures adequate nutrients for membranes, cell wall development and plant structure.<br>Products for organic use are specially formulated with the concerned grower in mind. Based on years of research and application,
          Baicor® products can provide the results that certified growers have come to trust. Baicor® products may be applied to the soil
          or in irrigation water in addition to foliar applications.<br>Products for organic use contain a series of selected natural organic compounds which chelate or complex nutrients and keep them in
          functional form until the plant utilizes them. This protects the nutrients from being tied-up within the plant or precipitation by sulfates,
          silicates and phosphates. The organic base of all Baicor® products is used as a food source by both plants and micro-organisms and is completely
          biodegradable thus reducing ground water contamination
