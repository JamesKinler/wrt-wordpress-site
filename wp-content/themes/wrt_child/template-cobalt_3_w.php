        <p>Cobalt is part of vitamin B-12 and is essential for all nitrogen fixing plants (peas, beans, alfalfa, etc.) in their symbiotic relationship with nodule bacteria.<br>Products for organic use are specially formulated with the concerned grower in mind. Based on years of research and application, Baicor® products
          can provide the results that certified growers have come to trust. Baicor® products may be applied to the soil or in irrigation water in addition
          to foliar applications.<br>Products for organic use contain a series of selected natural organic compounds which chelate or complex nutrients and keep them in functional
          form until the plant utilizes them. This protects the nutrients from being tied-up within the plant or precipitation by sulfates, silicates and
          phosphates. The organic base of all Baicor® products is used as a food source by both plants and micro-organisms and is completely biodegradable
          thus reducing ground water contamination.
