          Calphos™ is a unique product like no other. Through the innovation of our research team, Baicor® has been able to produce a product with high amounts of Calcium and Phosphorus that remain in solution. Calcium is primarily taken up through the root tips in the soil. In times of peak calcium demand,
          the plant may not be able to satisfy its needs by root uptake. This results in internal brown spot for potatoes, blossom end rot in tomatoes, bitter
          pit in apples etc. Foliar addition of calcium assures adequate nutrients for membranes, cell wall development and plant structure.

        <p class="calcium_12_sub">Benefits of Calcium</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Essential for cell wall formation and structure, necessary for development of firm fruit and vegetables.</li>
          <li>Regulates nutrient uptake by roots throughout entire plant. Helps grain and seed development.</li>
          <li>Essential for early and new root growth, enhances pollen germination.</li>
          <li>Necessary for protein and sugar transfer throughout plant. Stronger cell walls – helps resist disease and stress conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="calcium_12_sub">Benefits of Phosphorus</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Phosphorus can be quickly absorbed by the tissue and is very effective when applied as a foliar.</li>
          <li>The highest distribution of phosphorus within the plant is in the cell plasma and it is a key ingredient in the many energy requiring reactions in the plant.</li>
          <li>
            Plants with high level of phosphorus have increased tolerance to many stress conditions. Good phosphorus levels also help turf grass recover from stress or injury more rapidly. There are also some indications by several researchers the P plays a key role in reducing disease infections.</li>
