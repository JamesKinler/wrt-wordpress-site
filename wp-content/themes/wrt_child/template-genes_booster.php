          Gene’s Booster™ is specially formulated for crops and plants that utilize high amounts of nitrogen. Gene’s Booster™ is chelated with organic and amino acids found naturally in plants and soil. Gene’s Booster™ contains three forms of nitrogen for fast and long term uptake as well as phosphorus,
          potassium and chelated iron..
        </p><br>
        <p>Gene’s Booster™ is readily absorbed by the plant, translocated to various tissues and metabolized for optimum growth and development.</p><br>

            Iron Chlorosis is a world-wide problem. Almost all soils have adequate total iron but the amount of available iron to the plant is dependent on factors such as soil pH, iron forms and plant species. Iron is one of the least understood nutrients and the analysis (both soil and plant)
            is not accurate to determine effective levels for plant use. Foliar sprays of iron are the preferred way to supply this essential nutrient to plants.
            Iron is quite immobile when taken up through the roots; thus new growth often has iron deficiency.

        <p class="calcium_12_sub">Benefits of Gene’s Booster™</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The chelating agents contained in GENE’S BOOSTER™ are rapidly absorbed into the plant tissue to provide rapid and sustained green up.</li>
          <li>Provides both nitrogen and iron in high concentrations. Both nutrients are crucial to healthy greening due to their direct involvement in chlorophyll formation.</li>
          <li>Will mix in most solutions containing phosphate because of the total chelation of the micro-nutrients. The nutrients are readily absorbed by the plant for a faster response.</li>
          <li>Contains unique forms of phosphorus and potassium for complete plant use for balanced plant health.</li>
          <li>Compatible with most fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides available on the market today, however a jar test is recommended.</li>
