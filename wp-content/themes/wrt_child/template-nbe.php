          NBE™is a unique product that was designed to accelerate growth and development of seedlings. When applied on the seed, growth of the root and shoot is increased significantly in the first 10 days. For germinating seeds, this accelerated growth establishes a larger root mass,
          provides a shoot that is able to penetrate the soil surface and have a larger leaf surface to initiate a higher photosynthetic rate. This often
          means the difference between a good or successful crop and could eliminate reseeding under poor soil conditions.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          NBE™ regulates the growth both at the germination stage and later growth stages. Foliar applications have been shown to increase crop yield. In addition to the accelerated growth response, treated seeds are more resistant to diseases. This is provided through the presence of natural
          substances that induce disease resistance to the seedling and plant. This early resistance may help eliminate early rot of the seed and diseases
          common in seedlings.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          NBE™ has been scientifically tested on many crops and plants including wheat, potatoes, sugar beet, corn and grasses. The increase in root mass helps increase nutrient uptake and may help improve drought resistance of the plant.</p><br>
        <p>The seed needs to be wetted with NBE™ before planting or in the seed bed; foliar application is also an effective way of enhancing plant growth.</p><br>
        <p>
          NBE™ may be diluted 50 to 100 times depending on application procedures. It may be sprayed directly on the seed in the hopper or mixed directly with or applied over the seed.</p>
