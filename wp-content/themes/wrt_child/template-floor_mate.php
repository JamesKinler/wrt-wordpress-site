          In order to maximize profits from livestock production, large amounts of livestock are often concentrated to small living spaces. This poses many risks to farm sanitation, animal health and overall living conditions. Confining as many animals indoors as possible might maximize efficiency and profits, but it
          also exposes the animals to high levels of toxins from decomposing manure and can create ideal conditions for diseases to spread. Bio S.I.’s new Floor-Mate
          is used to maintain a clean and safe environment for their operations. Bio S.I.’s Floor-Mate allows farmers to keep their livestock clean from the manure and
          materials in their housing and protects livestock’s health from the dangerous toxins spurred as a result to ensure maximum production all year-round. To
          combat the odors from byproducts of animals like feces and clean their mess from tracking in dirt and other solids, Floor-Mate uses non-manure, naturally
          occurring soil inoculants. Garnering the power of nature with beneficial microbes, Floor-Mate safely and quickly improves conditions in areas where livestock
          is held. Microbes naturally break down the proteins, salts, and other materials found in urine and fecal matter, which can cause musty, unpleasant odors (ammonia).

          In addition to keeping livestock production up, Bio S.I.’s Floor-Mate allows one to keep your costs and labor demands down. Floor-Mate can be sprayed as a diluted solution or rinse with water after, depending on the application needs, for a clean area. Floor-Mate is applicable to all types of livestock areas
          such as poultry houses, horse stalls, dairy barns, hog barns, and anywhere livestock is held. One quart of Bio S.I. Floor-Mate will cover up to 1,000 square
          feet, allowing one to save money on less concentrated solution or additional supplies and save time demanded from alternative cleaning methods..
