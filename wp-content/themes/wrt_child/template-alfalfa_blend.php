          Alfalfa Blend™ is specially formulated for alfalfa and nitrogen fixing plants. Yield, relative feed value (RFV), protein and fiber content and other valuable components are important for alfalfa crops. Alfalfa Blend™ is a foliar fertilizer with a balanced phosphorus,
          potassium and nitrogen content containing high levels of trace nutrients, iron, copper, boron, molybdenum and cobalt. It is an ideal product to
          enhance plant growth and development.

        <p class="calcium_12_sub">Benefits of Alfalfa Blend™</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Potassium is required in high amounts for its many functions in plants. Over 40 enzymes require it for their activity. In addition, potassium is essential for the control of the stomata and thus is important in maintaining turgidity of plants and photosynthetic activity.
            Potassium is present in the readily usable organic acid form.
          </li>
          <li>
            Nitrogen is required for the over-all growth and development of the plant. Important components like amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids, etc all contain nitrogen.</li>
          <li>
            Phosphorus is readily absorbed by the plant cells and is required for energy processes in the cells of plants.</li>
          <li>Molybdenum, Iron, Copper and Boron are contained in this product, which are all essential for good plant growth and development.</li>
          <li>
            Molybdenum is required for the conversion of nitrates to amino acids and protein. Molybdenum is essential for nitrogen fixation that occurs in plants like alfalfa or microorganisms.</li>
          <li>Boron is required for hormone maintenance and carbohydrate conversion or translocation.</li>
          <li>
            Iron is essential for chlorophyll formation. Iron is also required by the plant for many metabolic roles including nitrate reduction, nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis. Iron is an activator and component for many enzymes that control plant respiration.</li>
          <li>
            ALFALFA BLEND™ is recommended to be applied at any cycle of growing season, before first crop cutting (when sufficient leaves are present.) to enhance the yield and the RFV/protein of the crop.</li>
