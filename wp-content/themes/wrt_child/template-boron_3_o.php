          Boron is essential for plant nutrition but is one of the least understood of all plant nutrients. It is involved in the synthesis and/or translocation of sucrose (sugars) in the plant. It is also connected with cell wall stability as with Calcium. In fact, it will help the absorption of Calcium for cell
          wall development. It is also necessary for the functioning of growth plant hormones. Products for organic use are specially formulated with the concerned
          grower in mind. Based on years of research and application, Baicor® products can provide the results that certified growers have come to trust. Baicor®
          products may be applied to the soil or in irrigation water in addition to foliar applications. Products for organic use contain a series of
          selected natural organic compounds which chelate or complex nutrients and keep them in functional form until the plant utilizes them. This protects the
          nutrients from being tied-up within the plant or precipitation by sulfates, silicates and phosphates. The organic base of all Baicor® products is used as a
          food source by both plants and micro-organisms and is completely biodegradable thus reducing ground water contamination
