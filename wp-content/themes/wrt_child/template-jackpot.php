          Bio S.I. Jackpot livestock probiotics brings beneficial, soil-borne microbes found in nature to your animals. Jackpot can be used for all animals such as: cows, pigs, goats, chickens, llamas. These microbes, which help to maintain an animals’ digestive systems, used to come from the soil while
          animals are grazing. Livestock kept in contained areas cannot maintain proper amounts of these microbes in their digestive systems. This may lead
          to them becoming stressed so they don’t perform well. By adding Jackpot to the drinking water, you will see them look and perform better. They will gain
          weight yet eat less. Jackpot may be sprayed over the quantity of food the animals will eat at one offering. Do not apply to food and store it.
