          Excel Triple 5™ is a high phosphate product and contains calcium. This combination is uique to only a few products, where both calcium and phosphate remain in true solution. Baicor researchers have produced Excel Triple 5™, which incorporates high amounts of calcium, phosphorus and also potassium. Calcium is
          primarily taken up through the underdeveloped root tip in the soul. At times of peak demand (although there is adequate calcium in the soil) the plan may experience
          deficiency. This may result in blossom end rot in tomato, bitter pit in apple, internal brown spot in potato, etc. Foliar addition of calcium may assure
          adequate nutrients for growth and development. Phosphorus is present in high amounts in the only plant usable phosphate form, phosphate. The highest
          concentration of phosphorus within the plant is in the cell plasma; it is intimately involved in all energy0related reactions. Plants with adequate phosphorus
          are more resistant to all stress conditions including disease infections.

          Potassium is required in large amounts by the plant. It is involved in over 40 enzymatic reactions, which are crucial in plant metabolism. The opening and closing of states, water relations and membrane integrity require the essential potassium nutrient.</p><br>
        <p>
          Nitrogen is required in high amounts for critical structural and metabolic roles, i.e. synthesis f building-block amino acids and complex metabolites such as proteins, nucleic acids and porphyrins. Nitrogen is present in the most usable nitrate for for uptake and translocation.</p>
