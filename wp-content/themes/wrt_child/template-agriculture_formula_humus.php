          Bio S.I. Ag Formula + Humus is a liquid soil inoculant with a broad and diverse spectrum of naturally occurring, beneficial soil borne microbes. They help rebuild the soil, convert organic matter to humus and help free up nutrients tied up in the soil. Plants are in a constant struggle to get
          nutrients they need at critical growth stages. Microbes work “hand in hand” with plants to get these nutrients to the plant in exchange for nutrients for
          their own use from plant exudates. If plant’s health is compromised, the exudates may not contain what the microbes need to survive. Ag Formula
          should be used as a part of your fertilizer program to improve the efficiency of both fertilizers and chemicals you use. It is hard for us to remember i
          n today’s world but prior to the development of industrial means to fix nitrogen plants were totally dependent on microbes for nitrogen. Microbes are
          the only know organisms that can transform gaseous nitrogen into an organic form (ammonia) that can be used by plants.
