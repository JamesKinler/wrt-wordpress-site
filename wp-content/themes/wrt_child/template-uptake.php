        <p>Uptake™ is unique and effective product that contains high amounts of phosphorus and potassium to enhance and stimulate plant and root development.</p><br>
        <p>
          Plants with high levels of phosphorus have an increased tolerance to many stress conditions; phosphorus levels help plants to recover from injury more rapidly. There are also reports that phosphorus plays a key role in reducing disease infection.</p><br>
        <p>Potassium stimulates over 40 enzymes within the plant that are responsible for plant growth and development.</p>
        <p class="calcium_12_sub">Benefits of Uptake™</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Phosphorus is one of the six macronutrients required by crops (nitrogen, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur). Phosphorus is often the most neglected by growers, yet no element plays a more important role in the overall metabolic process of the plant.</li>
          <li>Phosphorus can be quickly absorbed by the tissue and is very effective when applied as a foliar.</li>
          <li>The highest distribution of phosphorus within the plant is in the cell plasma and it is a key ingredient in the many energy requiring reactions in the plant.</li>
          <li>
            Plants with high level of phosphorus have and increased tolerance to many stress conditions. Good phosphorus levels also help crops recover from stress or injury more rapidly. There are also some indications by several researchers the P plays a key role in reducing disease infections.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          * Upon foliar application, the phosphite ions are taken up directly by the plant foliage and may undergo a degree of conversion to phosphate ions, or are utilized directly by plants, as phosphite ions.</p><br>
        <p>
          * As a soil application to annual crops, a lesser response from the initial crop, with a corresponding superior response from succeeding crops, may be observed. In addition, placement close to seeds or root zones may be injurious to crops. The effect may be aggravated by soil pH below 6.5.</p>
